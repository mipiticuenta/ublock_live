! # ublock_live

! Just a colletion of ublock rules intended for personal use, yet under heavy debugging.

! key guidelines:
!
! - Priorities (decreasing) :
!   - (highest) incoming : domains, urls filters.
!   - (high) outgoing info: params filter.
!   - (lowest) show info on screen: cosmetic filters.
!
! - simple, general filters preferred rather than complicated, specific ones.
! - regex only when efficient
! - exceptions only if no better choice.
